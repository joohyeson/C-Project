1. Name : Daeun Jeong, Juhye Son
* project name : CS225 PROJECT
* course name : CS225
* term : 20-07-20 ~ 20-08-07

2. The lists below are incomplete about the project.
- [ ] [**core**] Use Bitwise operations to create a some kind of configuration variable where you extract values. _(Combine bit flags of varying powers of 2)_
- [ ] [**core**] Use bitwise operations to replace Arithmetic Operations
- [ ] [**core**] Has examples of Return Value Optimization
- [ ] [**core**] Makes good use of Rule of 5
- [ ] [**core**] Makes good use of RAII
- [ ] [**core**] Makes good use of STL Iterators
- [ ] [**core**] Makes good use of STL Algorithms
- [ ] Reused functions as much as possible.
- [ ] Code is organized nicely across multiple files.
- [ ] Submitted pre-built executable(s) of the project on the course site

3. The lists below are complete about the project.
- [X] [**core**] All source code, data files and project files need to build and run the project are in this repo
- [X] [**core**] Created a ReadMe markdown file with all of the needed information
- [X] [**core**] Created a CoreTopics markdown file with all of the needed information
- [X] [**core**] Make good use of pointers and arrays
- [X] [**core**] Makes good use of Inheritance and Polymorphism
* MainMenu is using inheritance GameState. (And other states will use it too.)
- [X] [**core**] Makes good use of Rule of 0
* Level1(Mine sweeper) did not use the double pointer. We used vector<vector<int>> to avoid using Rule of 5.
- [X] [**core**] Makes good use of operator overloading
* in List.h and List.hpp.
- [X] [**core**] Makes good use of Templates
* Use Templates in List.h and List.hpp.
- [X] [**core**] Makes good use of STL Containers
* Input use std::bitset for the keyboard and the mouse, state manager use std::vector to get all game states.
- [X] All source files compile without warnings and without errors
- [X] Reasonably High Warning levels and treat warnings as errors are enabled.
- [X] Correct files submitted. No unnecessary files submitted.
- [X] No memory leaks detected with the CRT library.
- [X] All source files have a proper header comment with your name, project name, course name, term.
- [X] Followed the appropriate Code Quality Guidelines and Code Style Guidelines.
- [X] Utilize `clang-format` to automate code formatting
- [X] Source code submitted has no redundant computations.
- [X] Reused functions/code as much as possible.
- [X] Keep global variables to a minimum _(Allocate long lived objects on the stack in `main()` and then pass around pointers to it)_
- [X] No memory leaks detected with the CRT library, valgrind or Dr Memory.
- [X] All requirements that are completed are checked off here by replacing the `[ ]` with `[x]`
